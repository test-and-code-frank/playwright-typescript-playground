# 🧪 Playwright TypeScript Playground

A personal playground for exploring and experimenting with Playwright using TypeScript. This project serves two main purposes:

- To play around with Playwright features and best practices.

- To showcase my understanding and practical knowledge of writing scalable and maintainable test automation using Playwright and TypeScript.

## 💡 Experiment Highlights

- ### Page Object Model (POM)
  Using the Page Object Model pattern to encapsulate UI interactions and selectors for maintainability and readability.
  
  ✅ Each page/component has its own class in the /pages/ directory
  
  ✅ Constructor receives the `Page` object
  
  ✅ Methods expose common actions and assertions

- ### Retries & Trace on Retry
  Exploring how Playwright handles flaky tests through automatic retries and trace collection for debugging.

  ✅ Retry Configuration Enable retries in `playwright.config.ts`
  ```
  trace: 'on-first-retry'
  ```

  ✅ `View trace` on the html report for the failed test

  💡 Tips
  > Useful config when running test on CI. 
  > After the test run, upload the results artifacts and view the trace report

- ### Data-Driven Testing
  Exploring different approaches to run the same test logic against multiple sets of input data.

  ✅ Using Arrays + test.describe()
  
  ✅ Using CSV files as data sources. Used fs and csv-parse to read and parse test data
  
  🚧 Using Excel files as data sources
  
  > Attempted with exceljs, Issue: its async API didn’t play well with Playwright’s test declaration flow
  > Only one test would execute instead of iterating through all rows.
  > xlsx also has vulnerabilities.

- ### Assertions with Playwright
  Using Playwright Test Assertions to validate UI and behavior:

  ✅`expect(actualMessage).toBe(expectedMessage);` – Validating strings 
  
  ✅`expect(items.length).toBe(0)` – Validating item length
  
  ☐ `expect(locator).` - Validating locator properties.

- ### Screenshot on Failure
  Playwright automatically captures screenshots when a test fails (when configured). This helps with debugging visual or timing issues.
  
  ✅ Enabled via Playwright config: `screenshot: 'only-on-failure'`

- ### Test Reporting
  Experimenting with different reporting tools and formats to track test results effectively.

  ✅ Built-in HTML Reporter (Playwright)

- ### Configuration with YAML
  Experimenting with managing test data and dynamic config using .yaml files.
  
  ✅ Use Cases - Environment-specific settings (e.g., base URLs, credentials)

- ### Visual Comparisons
  Experimenting with Playwright's screenshot comparison to catch unexpected UI changes.

  ✅ Using expect(locator).toHaveScreenshot() to compare current UI state against a baseline image.
  ```
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(`${creds.username} invalid login message.png`);
  ```

## 🎯Project Goals

API Testing

Demonstrate best practices in automation testing with TypeScript.

Explore Playwright features like fixtures, context isolation, and tracing.

Use this as a portfolio project for future opportunities and growth.
